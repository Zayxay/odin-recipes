    <h4>Monologue</h4>
    
    <p>Here are 3 recipes that lack ingenuity or personality, making them perfect for a first date. However each recipe lies within a different hierarchy.</p>
    <p>The shrimp scampi pasta is used for a second date. Picture it. The night is winding down you guys just came back from the most exclusive entertainment establishment, Chuck-E-Cheese, and now are famished. You pull out a bottle of red, Bordeaux to be exact, and set the mood. You prepare the shrimp scampi pasta for 2, and watch as your date flushes over your unmatched cooking ability you learned from watching ludicrous hours of Master Chef. A perfect way to end a perfect date.  </p>
    <p>Bellow the scampi on the hierarchy is Fervent's Lasagna. Though delicious, the lasagna doesn't entice anyone, other than an orange cat that hates mondays.</p>
    <p> At the pinnacle of date recipes, The king among peasants, the cheesecake. Invented by the greek this dish was intended only for the tongue of the wealthy. To prepare this for a tinder expedition is to expose yourself as nothing more than an insect living among men. </p>
